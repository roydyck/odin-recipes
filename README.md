The Odin Project HTML Recipe Project

This project is the first main HTML project assignment from the Odin
Project.

Pre-project Expectations: At the end of this project, I should be able
to create a basic HTML website with recipes being the focus. I should
be able to correctly input all the necessary preamble, use tags properly,
use ordered and unordered lists, and add links and images.
