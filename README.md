The Odin Project HTML Recipe Project

This project is the first main HTML project assignment from the Odin
Project.

Pre-project Expectations: At the end of this project, I should be able
to create a basic HTML website with recipes being the focus. I should
be able to correctly input all the necessary preamble, use tags properly,
use ordered and unordered lists, and add links and images.

Post-project Review: At the close of this project, I was able to create
a website consisting of four webpages. It is very rudimentary and sometimes
tongue-in-cheek; it definetely could have been fleshed out more with back
links and "About" pages. I was able to use headings, ordered and unordered
lists, images, and links. I was even able to publish the site through github
